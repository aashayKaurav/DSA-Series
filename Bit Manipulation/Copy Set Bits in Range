//
Given two numbers x and y, and a range [l, r] where 1 <= l, r <= 32. Find the set bits of y in range [l, r] and set these bits in x also.

Example 1:

Input: 
X = 44, Y = 3 
L = 1,  R = 5
Output: 47
Explaination: presenation of 44 and 3 are 
101100 and 11. So in the range 1 to 5 there 
are two set bits. If those are set in 44 
it will become 101111 = 47.
//

int setSetBit(int x, int y, int l, int r){
        // From range l to r check whether bit is set in y if so then
        // copy to x.
        for(int i=l; i<=r; i++){
            //A number with only set bit at i'th position called mask.
            int mask = 1 << (i-1);
            
            if(y & mask){
                x = x | mask;
            }
        }
        return x;
    }
