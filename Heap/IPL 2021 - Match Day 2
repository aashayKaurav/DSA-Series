Due to the rise of covid-19 cases in India, this year BCCI decided to organize knock-out matches in IPL rather than a league.

Today is matchday 2 and it is between the most loved team Chennai Super Kings and the most underrated team - Punjab Kings. Stephen Fleming, the head coach of CSK, 
analyzing the batting stats of Punjab. He has stats of runs scored by all N players in the previous season and he wants to find the maximum score for each and 
every contiguous sub-list of size K to strategize for the game.

Example 1:

Input:
N = 9, K = 3
arr[] = 1 2 3 1 4 5 2 3 6
Output: 
3 3 4 5 5 5 6 
Explanation: 
1st contiguous subarray = {1 2 3} Max = 3
2nd contiguous subarray = {2 3 1} Max = 3
3rd contiguous subarray = {3 1 4} Max = 4
4th contiguous subarray = {1 4 5} Max = 5
5th contiguous subarray = {4 5 2} Max = 5
6th contiguous subarray = {5 2 3} Max = 5
7th contiguous subarray = {2 3 6} Max = 6
//

    ** Approach : SLIDING WINDOW (Maximum of all subarray of size k)

    vector<int> max_of_subarrays(vector<int> arr, int n, int k) {
        vector<int> ans;
        deque<int> dq;
        int i=0, j=0;
        while(j < n) {
            
            while(!dq.empty() && dq.back() < arr[j]) {
                dq.pop_back();
            }
            dq.push_back(arr[j]);
                if(j-i+1 < k) {
                    j++;
                }
            else {
                ans.push_back(dq.front());
                if(arr[i] == dq.front()) {
                    dq.pop_front();
                }
                i++;
                j++;
            }
        }
        return ans;
    }
    T.C : O(N)
    S.C : O(N)
